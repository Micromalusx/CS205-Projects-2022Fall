## Project 1 - A Simple Calculator
- Score: 94/100
- Comment: Great implementation!

## Project 2 - A Better Calculator
- Score: 93/100
- Comment: “The infix-to-postfix function is initially declared in calculator.hpp and defined in calculator.cpp, but for functions that return a string type, there is an error when called in main.cpp” I think there should be a better solution.
